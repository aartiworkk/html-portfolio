<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Aarti — an aspiring software developer with a passion for building impactful, user-centric applications. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a constant desire to learn and grow in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
<p>My journey into software development began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes — from simple websites to complex applications. Since then, I’ve been honing my skills in programming, problem-solving, and system design<br/>
  I’m particularly interested in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web development (front-end & back-end)</li>
  <li>Data structures and algorithms</li>
  <li>Building efficient, scalable applications</li>
  <li>Open-source contribution and continuous learning</li>
</ul>
<p>What excites me most about software development is the ability to turn ideas into real-world solutions that can improve lives and create value. Whether it’s writing clean, maintainable code or collaborating with a team to bring a project to life, I aim to approach every challenge with a growth mindset and a strong attention to detail<br/>
  I’m currently learning and building projects using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>React.js and Node.js</li>
  <li>C/C++ and Python</li>
  <li>Git & GitHub for version control</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer, contributing to innovative projects, and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, or solving coding challenges.

<br/>Let’s connect and create something amazing together!</p>
